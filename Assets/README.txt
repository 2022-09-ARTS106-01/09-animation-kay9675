Story:

Long before life first appeared in our solar system, the terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) and Jupiter, were
floating around in space being themselves. Suddenly, a small purple terrestrial planet they had never seen before flew in
out of nowhere. He introduced himself as the planet Liber, who had been wandering throughout the known galaxy in search of
a solar system to chill with. However, when he approved his two new neighbor planets (Earth and Mars), they shied away from him,
apparently uneasy at having to interact with this newcomer. Earth leaned away from Liber, while Mars made a break for it and
hid behind the much larger planet Jupiter. Liber was somewhat dissapointed, but this had happened many times in other solar
systems before - so he shrugged it off and flew away from Sol, just as quickly as he had appeared. Right after he left, Earth
stole a quick glance at the path Liber had taken, to make sure he had gone.

Principles of Animation:
Squash-and-stretch - used in how the planets fly in, and "shrink away" from each other
Anticipation - Some of the planets "take a step back" before making a move
Follow-through - Similarly to the anticipation step, the planets need to "rubber-band" slightly back after they make a move.

Emotions:
Fear (for the planets, who have never before met the new planet Liber and don't know what to make of him)
Dissapointment (Liber is shunned by the other planets)
Perplexment (Liber: "Why are the other planets afraid of me?")
Acceptance (Liber: "Oh well. I guess I'll go somewhere else and maybe they will accept me.")
